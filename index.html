        <p>I'm Thomas McDowell. A long time ago, I attended a summer camp put on by OMSI where I learned how to program a simple 2D game. While it didn't turn out particularly well, it did fuel my interest in dabbling with programming. Flash-forward 20-some-odd years, and my college friend, Patrick Lee, encouraged me to try out <span class="italic">Epicodus</span>, a coding school that helped him find a way to live a more fulfilling life. Reflecting on the work I found myself doing since graduating U of O in 2015, it sounded like a great opportunity to live a little more how I would like.</p>

        <h3>My Music:</h3>
        <a href=""><img src="" alt="Album Art"></a>
        <p>Music is perhaps the <strong>most</strong> important aspect of my life. I have played guitar for <span class="highlight">over 20 years</span> and it has been a lifelong aspiration to be a successful artist. Clicking the picture of our album above will take you to a YouTube video of our live set with Bridge City Sessions. Enjoy!</p>
