        <ul>
          <li>Epicodus Code Student</li>
          <li>Aspiring Musician</li>
          <li>"Just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe."</li>
        </ul>
          <p>I'm Thomas McDowell. A long time ago, I attended a summer camp put on by OMSI where I learned how to program a simple 2D game. While it didn't turn out particularly well, it did fuel my interest in dabbling with programming. Flash-forward 20-some-odd years, and my college friend, Patrick Lee, encouraged me to try out <span class="italic">Epicodus</span>, a coding school that helped him find a way to live a more fulfilling life. Reflecting on the work I found myself doing since graduating U of O in 2015, it sounded like a great opportunity to live a little more how I would like.</p>
          <p>In my first week at Epicodus, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and using Git repositories. This page is a demonstration of everything I have learend during that week in practice; as well as some additional exploration if I have time!</p>

      <h3>My Music:</h3>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J2iYeWQrJk"><img  src="img/ALBUM+FRONT.png" alt="Album Art"></a>
      <p>Music is perhaps the <strong>most</strong> important aspect of my life. I have played guitar for <strong><span class="highlight">over 20 years</span></strong> and it has been a lifelong aspiration to be a successful artist. Clicking the picture of our album above will take you to a YouTube video of our live set with Bridge City Sessions. Enjoy!</p>
